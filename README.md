Derminal
========

Derminal is a terminal written in D using GTK, that is made to integrate nicely with existing GUI.

It does so by remapping usual terminal command of the form ctrl+letter (like ctrl+C) into super+letter (ie super+C). It then uses ctrl to provide shortcuts expected by any GUI users (ctrl+C to copy, ctrl+V to paste and ctrl+T for new tab).
